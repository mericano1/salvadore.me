## Some of my principles

### People come first. 
Your work-life balance, you general health, your satisfaction at work, your feedback. [more here from peakon]

### Once we know it's going to be there, quality has to follow. 
Quick and dirty is needed to learn, to confirm assumptions, to fit the right product market fit, to experiment. Once that phase is over then proper engineering practises must be put in place for sustainability. Engineers need to be proud of what they are building. To be able to sustain change over time we need to constantly refactor to include new learnings, better understanding of the problem, new technologies, new customer trends, etc.

### Tech is exciting when is got a purpose.

- You tell me if you are not happy about something.

## How I normally work

### 1-2-1

I will have regular catch ups with you. The aim of those sessions is to get to know each other better. They are *not* status updates. If they start turning into that, we will need to find some better mechanisms to keep me in the loop (emails, reports, etc).

I am much more keen to covers topics like your team, how things are going, how happy you are, your interests, your career development or maybe your weekend or your latest trip or favourite band.
