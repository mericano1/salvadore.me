## Leadership Principles

### People come first

Your work-life balance, your general health, your satisfaction at work, your feedback.

### Focus on quality

Don't get me wrong - quick and dirty has its purpose. If you need to learn, to confirm assumptions, to find the right product market fit, to experiment. But once that phase is over then proper engineering practices must be put in place for sustainability. Engineers need to be proud of what they are building. To be able to sustain change over time we need to constantly refactor to include new learnings, better understanding of the problem, new technologies, new customer trends, etc.

### Tech is exciting when it's got a purpose

I am product-driven. I am excited to build products that have a purpose and can make a difference to people in some way.
We are living in very exciting times. Technology is so accessible, ideas are flowing and anyone has a chance to build something. Execution will be the key to success.
