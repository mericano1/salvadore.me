# Hi 👋, I'm Andrew

I am a father of two boys, a husband and a technology leader. I work for [Coinrule](web.coinrule.com). We help people automate their crypto trading strategies with a simple and accessible UI.

## Some of my principles 🧠

### People come first.

Your work-life balance, you general health, your satisfaction at work, your feedback.

### Focus on quality

Don't get me wrong - quick and dirty has its purpose. If you need to learn, to confirm assumptions, to find the right product market fit, to experiment. But once that phase is over then proper engineering practises must be put in place for sustainability. Engineers need to be proud of what they are building. To be able to sustain change over time we need to constantly refactor to include new learnings, better understanding of the problem, new technologies, new customer trends, etc.

### Tech is exciting when is got a purpose

I am product-driven. I am excited to build products that have a purpose and can make a difference to people in some way.
We are living in very exciting times. Technology is so accessible, ideas a flowing and anyone has a chance to build something. Execution will be the key to success.

## Work

### My objectives

👉 WIP. Feel free to make some suggestions

### My commitments

- Be always open and honest.
- Give you continuous, constructive feedback.
- Foster an inspiring place to work where everyone's encouraged to innovate, challenge the status quo and always aim higher.
- Provide context and clarity on our vision, objectives and purpose.
- Help people find an exciting career path either in technology or management.

### My expectations

#### You

- are always open and honest
- do the best job you can

#### Please come talk to me 🙏

- if your purpose, objectives or priorities are not clear.
- about your concerns before they become problems. I am always open to hear you out, no matter the topic or how silly you feel it might be.
- if you are unable to do a great job or need some support / help.
- if your work load is not sustainable.
- if you are not happy about something

### 1-2-1

I will have regular catch ups with you. The aim of those sessions is to get to know each other better. They are *not* status updates. If they start turning into that, we will need to find some better mechanisms to keep me in the loop (emails, reports, etc).

I am much more keen to covers topics like your team, how things are going, how happy you are, your interests, your career development or maybe your weekend or your latest trip or favourite band.
